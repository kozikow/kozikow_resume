Credits

I forked the https://github.com/mliu7/latex-moderncv.

Latex is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia. You can find out more about it here: http://www.latex-project.org/

If you are looking for latex resume templates, I would recommend looking at this nice list an anonymous person put together: http://linuxandfriends.com/2009/12/28/latex-resume-templates/

The moderncv theme for my resume is contributed by Xavier Danaux and can be downloaded here: http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/

Prerequisites
=============

You will need to have latex installed on your system. If you are using OSX, the easiest way to get up and running is to download MacTex: http://tug.org/mactex/

Compiling the Resume
====================

Simply use the ``pdflatex`` command in your terminal::

    pdflatex my-resume.tex
    
You may need to add /usr/texbin to your PATH.

Notes
=====

You are free to take my .tex file and modify it to create your own resume. Please don't use my resume for anything else without my permission, though! 

Good luck!
